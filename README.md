# [Scala Days Chicago](http://event.scaladays.org/scaladays-chicago-2017)

The Scala Center is organizing an *Open Source Spree* at Scala Days, on Tuesday, April 18.

The goal of this event is to make contributors and users of Scala open source projects
meet and hack for the good of the Scala community!

## Where and when?

Swissôtel Chicago<br />
